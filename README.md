# 🤝 Togetherness & Tiny Joys

*A cozy little corner of the web, built with heart.*

## 🌸 What is this?

**Togetherness & Tiny Joys** is a friendship-themed website dedicated to celebrating the small, beautiful moments we share with the people who make our lives better — our best friends. Inspired by soft kawaii visuals and a love for pastel palettes, this site is more than just cute — it’s meaningful, memorable, and made for someone special.

## 🧠 Why does it exist?

Because sometimes, a simple webpage can speak louder than a thousand selfies.  
Because the best friendships deserve to be **preserved**, **cherished**, and maybe even **animated into a gif**.  
Because smiles should be shared — in pixels too.

For that one person who makes you say, *“I’m glad we met.”*
